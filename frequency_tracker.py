"""
Working on...

Spin up the user_calculations.db and user.db

Plan to deploy on Render (free tier works great for FastAPI)

Later, connect it to PostgreSQL (e.g., Supabase, Railway, or Renderâ€™s own DB service)

Support for the seasonalty frequency calculations
Support fot tier 2 or monthly goals
Be able to put dates that shouldnt matter to the calculation (sick time, vacation time, injury, etc.)
Be able to ingest ALL my strava data
Be able to calculate the average from a specific date
Give a "start" date for when you want an activity to being being calcualted from (for total avg)
